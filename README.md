In 2021, Oregon became the first US state to decriminalize possession of illegal drugs. As more and more states have started legalizing marijuana in the US, the traditional viewpoint of how governments punish drug use has come under question. It is important to analyze the potential positive or negative effects associated with drug laws. The objective of this project is to understand how the United States may be impacted by adopting a more lenient drug policy, such as one similar to Portugal’s or Switzerland’s. Features that we are currently considering for our model — in addition to drug policy — include population, some infrastructure rating (such as GDP), and policies of neighboring countries. After validating our model on a validation set, we will use data from the United States to predict future hospitalizations from drug-related incidents inferring that the US adopts a lenient policy akin to the more lenient ones we are studying.
